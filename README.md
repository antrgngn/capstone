# The Devil Wears Data

## Project Overview
Fashion doesn't exempt all of us. Miranda Priestley would disagree that this is all just a pile of "stuff." This is to support her, in a data approach.

The GitHub repository includes source code for sentiment analysis, the dataset (so far 2 houses), and a comprehensive codebook detailing the varaibles.
